# Back ðŸ”™

## Steps

In order to go back, you need to code two steps.

1. Add a `onBack` callback on the `Screen` you are going back from. Make sure this callback affects the visibility (prop `visible`) of the screen you are going back from.
2. Call `Navigation.instance.back()` (`import { Navigation } from 'react-gondola'`).

You're set ðŸŽ¸.
