# Can React Nonav work with React Navigation ‚ù§Ô∏è ?

Yes it can.

## Good use of both of us üëç

1. The user is free to navigate on some top level pages (use `react-navigation`).
2. The user is forced to move forward/backward when he completes come steps in low level tunnels (use `react-nonav`).

This means that at a certain point in your navigation, you need to control the visibility of your page. That great power comes with great responsability.
‚úÖ Test your state machine !

## How well it works ?

**Disclaimer:** interoperability has not been entirely tested. If you encounter any issue, feel free to open an issue on the `react-nonav` repo.

## Steps

1. Include one `Canal` inside a `react-navigation` page.
2. Disable `gesture` on that `react-navigation` page.
3. Disable `onBack` setting `<AndroidBackHandler onBackPress={() => {if (youWantToGoBackInReactNavigation()) {return false}; return true} />` in your `react-navigation` page (use `https://github.com/vonovak/react-navigation-backhandler`).
