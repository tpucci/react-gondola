# React Nonav

React Native declarative and reactive navigation.

## Philosophy

This repo focuses on grouping screens by business conversion tunnels called **canals**. Why did I call it `react-nonav`? Just because I though of this package when I was visiting Venice... and I kind of hope that using this package will feel like navigating in Venice 📸

**When you use React Nonav**, you define several screens and you have the possibility to control their visibility with YOUR state machine. You define the rules of WHEN some screens should appear; `react-nonav` takes care of the rest.

## When to use this package

### 👍 TLDR; Use this package if:

- you want to group screens by **business** conversion tunnels rather than transition.
- you want to control your navigation state with YOUR **state machine**.
- you want your navigation to **react** to YOUR store changes.

### 👎 Do not use this repo if:

- you want to navigate imperatively.
- you need to use Native navigation (react-nonav's navigation is powered by JS code only).
