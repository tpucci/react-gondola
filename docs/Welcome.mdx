# React Gondola

React Native declarative and reactive navigation.

## Philosophy

This repo focuses on grouping pages by business conversion tunnels called **canals**. When navigating in Venice, you can not teleport yourself from the beginning of a canal to the end of it. You are forced to either go ahead or go back; and doing so you might discover another canal. **When you use React Gondola**, define several gondoliers and hhow they are authorize to move accross their canals.

## When to use this package

### üëç TLDR; Use this package if:

- you want to group pages by **business** conversion tunnels rather than transition.
- you want to control your navigation state with a **state machine**.
- you want you navigation to **react** to your store changes.

### üëé Do not use this repo if:

- you want to navigate imperatively.
- you need to use Native navigation (react-gondola's navigation is powered by JS code only).
