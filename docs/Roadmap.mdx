# Roadmap

If there is a real interest on `react-nonav` and its phylosophy, I might add support for the following features:

import { StrikeThrough } from "./components/StrikeThrough";

- <StrikeThrough>go back event listener</StrikeThrough> 🎉 Done !
- <StrikeThrough>transitions</StrikeThrough> 🎉 Done !
- navigation gestures

Tweet me some encouragements 😁 and star the repo !

import GitHubButton from "react-github-btn";

<GitHubButton
  href="https://github.com/tpucci/react-nonav"
  data-icon="octicon-star"
  data-size="large"
  data-show-count="true"
  aria-label="Star tpucci/react-nonav on GitHub"
>
  Star
</GitHubButton>
