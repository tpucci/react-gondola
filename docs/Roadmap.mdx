# Roadmap

If there is a real interest on `react-gondola` and its phylosophy, I might add support for the following features:

- go back event listener
- transitions
- navigation gestures

Tweet me some encouragements 😁 and star the repo !

import GitHubButton from "react-github-btn";

<GitHubButton
  href="https://github.com/tpucci/react-gondola"
  data-icon="octicon-star"
  data-size="large"
  data-show-count="true"
  aria-label="Star tpucci/react-gondola on GitHub"
>
  Star
</GitHubButton>
