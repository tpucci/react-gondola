## Philosophy

This repo focuses on grouping screens by business conversion tunnels called **canals**. Why did I call it `react-gondola`? Just because I though of this package when I was visiting Venice... and I kind of hope that using this package will feel like navigating in Venice üì∏

**When you use React Gondola**, you define several screens and you have the possibility to control their visibility with YOUR state machine. You define the rules of WHEN some screens should appear; `react-gondola` takes care of the rest.

## üëç TLDR; Use this package if:

- you want to group screens by **business** conversion tunnels rather than transition.
- you want to control your navigation state with YOUR **state machine**.
- you want your navigation to **react** to YOUR store changes.

## üëé Do not use this repo if:

- you want to navigate imperatively.
- you need to use Native navigation (react-gondola's navigation is powered by JS code only).
