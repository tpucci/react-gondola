# React Gondola

React Native declarative and reactive navigation.

## Philosophy

This repo focuses on grouping pages by business conversion tunnels called **canals**. When navigating in Venice, you can not teleport yourself from the beginning of a canal to the end of it. You are forced to either go ahead or go back; and doing so you might discover another canal üò≤. **When you use React Gondola**, you define several gondoliers and how each one of them is authorized to move accross its own canal.

## üëç TLDR; Use this package if:

- you want to group pages by **business** conversion tunnels rather than transition.
- you want to control your navigation state with a **state machine**.
- you want your navigation to **react** to your store changes.

## üëé Do not use this repo if:

- you want to navigate imperatively.
- you need to use Native navigation (react-gondola's navigation is powered by JS code only).
